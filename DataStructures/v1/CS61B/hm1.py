Problem 1 --------- Write a program that reads a String from the keyboard. The program should then
construct a URL for http://www.X.com/, replacing X with the String read in, and
print the first five lines of the Web page at that URL in REVERSE ORDER; i.e.,

Write a program called "Nuke2.java" containing a class called Nuke2 whose main
method reads a string from the keyboard and prints the same string, with its
second character removed. (Thatâ€™s character number 1, since Java numbers
characters in a string starting from zero.) In other words, after you run
"java Nuke2", if you type in the string "skin", the program will print "sin".
